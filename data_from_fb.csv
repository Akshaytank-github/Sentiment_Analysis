About 6-7 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the parasite that causes Chagas disease – causing 10 000 deaths yearly. This potentially life-threatening illness is transmitted through contact with the faeces or urine of a triatomine or ‘kissing’ bug found mainly in Latin America. It can also be transmitted from mother-to-child, contaminated food, blood transfusion and organ transplantation.
There is no vaccine for Chagas’ disease but it can be cured provided you get help early enough:the efficacy of drugs diminishes the longer a person has been infected."

"“I was born with HIV. I faced my first real struggles with HIV when I was a bubbly 9-year-old girl. Somehow word got around – even teachers started whispering behind my back. In high school, I met another girl who was also HIV positive and facing very bad stigma. I realized that fear can sometimes be a worse disease so I decided to speak up, revealing that I, too, had HIV. Since 2014, I have worked with Y+, a global network of young people living with HIV. We provide access to information, safe spaces, psychosocial services and skills for integrated HIV, sexual and reproductive health and rights. We should remind ourselves that HIV is not over.

After some time, I accepted my new life and received counselling and treatment. I also decided to ‘go public’ with my status, which was met with mixed reactions and some backlash. Some people thought I was making it up, seeking attention and funding, as I did not have the “face of AIDS”. My modelling business collapsed overnight as all my models deserted my agency because of the stigma. However, I had my family to be my pillar of support. In 2003, I founded an organization called the Public Personalities Against AIDS Trust. I wanted to break the stigma associated with… More"

My best friend from 2008 is in good health and became an HIV champion for his community. I run testJKT, a sex-positive online campaign. We collaborated with more than 100 social media influencers to generate demand of HIV testing in Jakarta. But recently, we’ve been facing more crackdowns in key communities, which makes it harder to reach people with HIV services.”

After a year of crying, I tested for HIV and started treatment. I got married in 2007 and now have 2 children. Because I’ve been on treatment and am healthy, my children are HIV-free. Going through the experience, I saw that many women were suffering from abuse, violence and isolation, not knowing what to do after realizing they have HIV. In 2015, I set up a small organization called Community Health Support and Empowerment Initiative - CHSEI, NGO (COHSEI). We have helped over 200 women and children stay at our shelters, and… More"

"“If you say that the work is dirty, let me tell you: there is no dirty work, there are only dirty problems. It is true that our job is to empty the faeces from the latrine pits, but where do the faeces come from? Don’t they come out of people's bodies before ending up in the pit? What I like about this job is not that I find it easy, but I can say that if there weren't emptiers like us, there would be a problem. The pits would be filled without being emptied. It's our way to bring our contribution to society.
Once a syringe pricked me in a pit. When I finished work and I went home, and later my hand was swollen and hurt. I had to go to clean another latrines the next day. So, I went to the health centre, I was prescribed medication and I was vaccinated and everything went back to normal.”

"“I am over 50 years old. I have been working as a sanitation worker for more than 30 years. Many things end up in large sewers. The sewage board gave me a gun to walk through the sewer. The water in that large sewer is knee deep, and has all sorts of creatures in it. Snakes, birds, rats. Hence the gun.
Once I walked to a large sewer line to clear a rotten cow stuck in the sewer. I had to cut the rotting cow with a saw. It took me almost an entire day. When I had to go home, I could not take a bus, or a rickshaw as I was stinking because of the rotten cow. I walked for two hours to get home. Even while walking I had to stay as far from the public as possible. Now I don't do such things. I'm not sure how they are taking care of those blockages these days. For the last five years I have been finding jobs to clear residential blockages. People know where to find me.”

But now, this is the second time Ebola has infected the district. People are more welcoming and want our help. It can be difficult, but when we help people, when we find all the people who have been in contact with an infected patient and help them to get vaccinated, it feels good.”

This action is a precautionary and preventive step to maximize the containment of the virus in the interest of the health of the American public.
These individuals will continue to be housed at the March Air Reserve Base in Ontario, California. Medical staff will continue to monitor the health of each traveler. If an individual presents symptoms, medical care will be readily available.

"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-NCoV) is causing an outbreak of respiratory illness with Wuhan City, China as the epicenter. Five cases in travelers from Wuhan have been detected in the U.S.; a 6th case has been reported in a close contact with travel history, suggesting person-to-person spread.
Genetic sequencing suggests the 2019-nCoV has its origins in bats, but now is able to spread from person to person. Experts believe this spread is happening mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, the same way flu and other respiratory viruses spread.
You can help stop the spread of viruses and prevent respiratory illnesses by practicing good health habits, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.

"Vaccines prevent an estimated 2-3 million deaths every year, however, if global vaccination coverage improved an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided.

As of 2018, global coverage for three doses of the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV) was 86%. However, only 66% of countries met the GVAP goal for DTP3, and 61% met the GVAP goal for MCV.

2) Always wash hands and utensils well after preparing food
3) Don’t eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, frogs or shrimp/prawns
4) If you handle snails or slugs, wear gloves and wash your hands
5) When travelling in areas where the parasite is common, avoid eating uncooked vegetables

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a large country in Central Africa with more than 85 million people. The ongoing Ebola outbreak in DRC continues to grow and threaten other countries. This outbreak is the largest to occur in DRC and is now the second largest Ebola outbreak in the history of the disease. Only by the 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was larger. The outbreak is occurring in a highly insecure environment, which complicates public health response activities and increases the risk of disease spread.

This special webinar will be held by CDC’s Emergency Partners Information Connection, CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and CDC Global. They will discuss the current situation and how organizations sending US-based workers to areas with Ebola can ensure the health and safety of their workers before, during, and after deployment.

"Chagas disease, and the triatomines (“kissing bugs”) that transmit it, have been in the news lately. It’s important to know transmission in the US is rare, and there have been fewer than 100 cases of known locally acquired Chagas disease since human cases were first reported in 1955.
To protect yourself and your pets from contact with triatomine bugs, CDC suggests that you:
- Seal cracks and gaps around windows, walls, roofs, and doors
- Remove wood, brush, and rock piles near your house
- Use screens on doors and windows and repair any holes or tears
- If possible, make sure yard lights are not close to your house (lights can attract the bugs)
- Seal holes and cracks leading to the attic, crawl spaces below the house, and to the outside
- Have pets sleep indoors, especially at night
- Keep your house and any outdoor pet resting areas clean, and occasionally check both areas for the presence of bugs

An infectious blackfly will typically drop larvae when biting a person. The larvae then penetrate the skin to infect the person. Because the worms reproduce only in humans but need to complete some of their development inside the blackfly, the intensity of human infection (number of worms in an individual) is related to the number of infectious bites sustained by an individual.

"🔎Guess the Parasite:
This parasite causes a condition in humans known as Pediculosis. The infestation it causes can be found on the body, or on the head and face. The female of this species is approximately 3-4mm long. Its legs are adapted for clinging to a host’s hair and it lays its eggs on hair shafts, which are held tightly by a cementlike substance, making them difficult to remove. Infestations caused by this parasite are spread mostly by close person-to-person contact. Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the transmission. This parasite moves by crawling; it cannot hop or fly. Both over-the-counter and prescription medications are available for treatment.

"🔎Guess the Parasite:
This #parasitic #disease can occur if you come into contact with freshwater that is home to snails carrying the parasite. Once the parasite penetrates the skin, it begins to migrate through host tissue and develop into adult worms inside the blood vessels. Symptoms of this parasitic illness occur as a result of the body’s reaction to the egg production by the female worms. Within days, you may develop a rash or itchy skin. Fever, chills, cough, and muscle aches can follow within 1-2 months. After years with the infection, the parasite can damage the liver, intestine, lungs, and bladder.

"🔎Guess the Parasite:
This #parasite can cause problems that could ruin your warm-weather fun. Many species of this #parasite infect humans and a wide range of animals, but two of them are most prevalent for causing illness in humans. Both the parasite and the disease are commonly known by the same name.
This parasite can be spread in several different ways, but water (drinking water and recreational water) is the most common way it’s spread. In fact, it’s a leading cause of waterborne disease among humans in the U.S. Many outbreaks in the U.S. have occurred in waterparks, community swimming pools, and day care centers. Infection with this parasite can cause simple infections to severe, life-threatening threatening illness.
And just why is this parasite so tough? It’s protected by an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time and makes it very tolerant to chlorine disinfection.

This #parasite causes a disease that infects red blood cells and is spread a certain tick: the Ixodes scapularis.
In the U.S., tickborne diseases are most common in particular regions and seasons; this disease mainly occurs in parts of the Northeast and upper Midwest and usually peaks during the warm months.
Once this parasite infects a human, there is little, if any subsequent transmission to humans. Humans are, for all practical purposes, dead-end hosts and there is probably little, if any, subsequent transmission that occurs from ticks feeding on infected persons. However, human to human transmission is well recognized to occur through blood transfusions.
In the U.S. this parasite is the agent most frequently identified (Northeast and Midwest), and can occur in individuals who’ve had their spleens removed.

"Thanks to support from The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and partners, AIDS-related deaths have declined by nearly 50 percent globally since their peak. As PEPFAR celebrates its 15th anniversary, up to 13 PEPFAR-supported countries could achieve epidemic control by 2020, creating the roadmap for the more than 50 countries that PEPFAR supports. Epidemic control will be achieved only by ensuring access to HIV services for all populations, including the most vulnerable and at-risk.
CDC works in more than 50 countries, with PEPFAR support, using the latest science and the best available data to direct U.S. resources where the HIV/AIDS epidemic is the largest, the need is highest, and dollars are most efficiently used.
Thanks to the compassion and generosity of the American people, PEPFAR has made lasting impact that has brought us ever closer to a world without AIDS."
"In May 2003, the U.S. government launched The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in response to what was a growing epidemic. Through the compassion and generosity of the American people—and outstanding partnerships—PEPFAR has accelerated global progress toward controlling and ultimately ending the AIDS epidemic as we know it. Fifteen years later, PEPFAR has altered the course of the global HIV/AIDS epidemic—saving millions of lives around the world, improving the lives of countless others, and preventing millions of infections along the way.

We are getting a lot of questions about how people who believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 should go about getting tested.
If a person has questions about being tested for COVID-19, they should call their healthcare provider to make arrangements for testing. It is important to call your healthcare provider's office before going in to let them know you may have COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider's office take steps to keep others from getting infected or exposed to COVID-19.
Once the provider has contacted ADPH and a person is tested, the specimen should be sent from the provider to our State Lab, the Bureau of Clinical Laboratories (BCL) in Montgomery. Confirmatory testing is done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
For any persons not meeting ADPH’s criteria for testing but physicians still want to test them, they have been asked to please work with commercial labs of their choice."

ADPH recommends persons do not show up at county health departments or healthcare providers without first contacting them. This will help reduce the risk of spreading respiratory infections. Evaluation and testing is recommended to be conducted by trained staff using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in negative pressure rooms. ADPH has identified county health departments with operational negative pressure rooms and is prepared to shift trained staff to these locations if necessary.

Protecting your parents from financial exploitation:
Financial exploitation or abuse of older adults occurs when a person’s resources are used by another for personal profit or gain, or actions that deprive an older person of the benefits entitled to them. No one is immune. This sort of theft can happen to anyone regardless of social standing and education levels.
Financial abuse can come from all corners. Some businesses prey on older adults and use unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices. That said, not all of the abusers are strangers. Many times financial exploitation is committed by a person that your loved one knows and trusts.

And if you’re the passenger, remember that it is illegal in the state of Alabama to hang your arms and legs outside the boat or to sit above the gunwale or cap of a vessel while moving above idle speed. https://www.alea.gov/dps/marine-patrol/boating-rules-and-regulations

"A stroke occurs when the brain’s blood supply is blocked by a blood clot or damaged vessel. Without a constant supply of oxygen from the bloodstream, brain cells struggle to remain active and are lost at a rate of approximately 1.9 million per minute.
To recognize the signs of stroke, use the acronym FAST:
Face. Ask the person to smile. If the person is experiencing a stroke, one side of the mouth may droop.
Arms. Ask the person to raise both arms. Stroke will often cause one arm to drift downward.
Speech. Ask the person to repeat a sentence. Stroke may cause speech to be slurred.
Time. If you see signs of a possible stroke, immediately call 911."

It's fairly significant whenever SPC has a severe weather risk beyond day 3 and I have attached the day 5 outlook which has the majority of the tri-state region in a threat area. As the threat falls on Sunday, we wanted to get the word out to everyone early for planning and notification purposes.
The medium range models are in good agreement in forecasting a potential squall line entering southeast Alabama and the western Florida panhandle in the late morning then progressing eastward with time reaching I-75 and the Florida Big Bend by late afternoon/early evening.
Please monitor for updates through the rest of the week as the timing of this event could change.
THREATS: Damaging winds and isolated tornadoes will be the main threats.
TIMING: Beginning Sunday morning across SE AL and western FL panhandle and spreading east through the afternoon/evening hours."

Kidney disease often has no symptoms, and it can go undetected until very advanced. But a simple urine test can tell you if you have kidney disease. Remember, it's important to get tested because early detection and treatment can slow or prevent the progression of kidney disease."

The November 2019 AJPH podcast is out here: https://am.ajph.link/POD_November2019. The US system of insurance is at a crossroads. Will it continue to grow incrementally or are we on the brink of a profound transformation in which all of the existing financing institutions are canceled and replaced by a single system? This complex machine was built progressively and underwent many social and political battles. The population coverage has improved in quantity and quality over time but remains a combination of sometimes contradictory systems and, importantly, it leaves out 30 million people without health insurance. My guests are Prof Jonathan Oberlander (University of North Carolina) and Dean Sherry Glied (New York University)"

Since the first sale of African captives in 1619, North America has had about 250 years when slavery was legal and 150 years during which slavery was abolished. In this podcast I discuss whether this slavery past has left an imprint on public health in the United States. I also trace the mechanisms for which the impacts of this history can still be observed today.

The dramatic epidemic of opioid addiction and death by overdose has obscured the fact that millions of people suffer from pain, need to be treated, but are denied access to care. The two problems of pain management and opioid addiction are intricate and the situation has grown out of control, there is little or no evidence to support an alternative approach, and the possible solutions are years away from being even implemented. My interviewees are Richard Bonnie, Mark Rothstein, Mark Schumacher, and Daniel Carr.

2. What did you LEARN by attending this conference?
The IH Luncheon speaker was a wonder of information and inspiration about current and past anti-nuclear war work in the US.
3. Why should others attend the conference?

Their message is: Congress needs to quickly require OSHA to pass an infectious disease standard to protect health care and other workers exposed to Covid-19. A draft of the standard exists.

The November 2019 AJPH podcast is out here: https://am.ajph.link/POD_November2019. The US system of insurance is at a crossroads. Will it continue to grow incrementally or are we on the brink of a profound transformation in which all of the existing financing institutions are canceled and replaced by a single system? This complex machine was built progressively and underwent many social and political battles. The population coverage has improved in quantity and quality over time but remains a combination of sometimes contradictory systems and, importantly, it leaves out 30 million people without health insurance.

Since the first sale of African captives in 1619, North America has had about 250 years when slavery was legal and 150 years during which slavery was abolished. In this podcast I discuss whether this slavery past has left an imprint on public health in the United States. I also trace the mechanisms for which the impacts of this history can still be observed today.

A multifaith team of guest editors, led by Ellen Idler, and comprising Anwar Khan, Jeff Levin, and Tyler VanderWeele, has assembled a set of articles illustrating how faith-based organizations have contributed to public health at the local, state, or global levels. I further discuss if the mission of public health is compatible with views expressed by some religious congregations that appear to contradict the fundamental principles of equity and health. My interviewees are Ellen Idler (Emory), Bill Foege (Emory), Rob, Pyne (St Norbert) , and Mimi Kiser (Emory)."

The dramatic epidemic of opioid addiction and death by overdose has obscured the fact that millions of people suffer from pain, need to be treated, but are denied access to care. The two problems of pain management and opioid addiction are intricate and the situation has grown out of control, there is little or no evidence to support an alternative approach, and the possible solutions are years away from being even implemented. My interviewees are Richard Bonnie, Mark Rothstein, Mark Schumacher, and Daniel Carr.

Today's the last day to share information about past conferences from leadership. Today's spotlight is on Mary Anne. Check out what she has to say below!
1. What did you LOVE about a past APHA conference?
I was the ‘handler’ for a high-level guest speaker from Ecuador, Jaime Breilh, and it was a real joy. We did some sightseeing in Atlanta together and I learned a lot about his work and perspectives.
2. What did you LEARN by attending this conference?
